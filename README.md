# Basilisque - Auto Implementer

## Overview
This project provides functionality to automatically implement interfaces.

[![NuGet Basilisque.AutoImplementer](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet_Basilisque.AutoImplementer-latest-blue.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Basilisque.AutoImplementer)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%20License%202.0-red.svg)](LICENSE.txt)

## Description
This project contains a source generator that automatically implements interface members in classes implementing the interfaces.  
The goal is to provide a workaround for C# not supporting multiple inheritance for some basic use cases.

## Getting Started
Install the NuGet package [Basilisque.AutoImplementer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Basilisque.AutoImplementer).  
Installing the package will add the source generator to your project.

Now you're ready to [start implementing your interfaces automatically](https://github.com/basilisque-framework/AutoImplementer/wiki/Getting-Started).


## Features
- Properties of interfaces will be added as auto-implemented properties

## Examples
Create the interfaces:
```csharp
[AutoImplementInterface()]
public interface ITitle
{
  [Required] string Title { get; set; } // implements 'Title' as 'required' in .NET 7.0+
}

[AutoImplementInterface()]
public interface IDetails
{
  byte[]? Image { get; set; }
  string Summary { get; set; }
}
```
Create some classes implementing the interfaces:
```csharp
public partial class Book : ITitle, IDetails
{ /* will have the properties Title, Image and Summary */ }

public partial class Movie : ITitle, IDetails
{ /* will have the properties Title, Image and Summary */ }

public partial class Song: ITitle
{ /* will have the property Title */ }
```

The source generator now adds the members to the corresponding classes without you having to do this on your own every time.
